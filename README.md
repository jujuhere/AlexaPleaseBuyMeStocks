# AlexaPleaseBuyMeStocks - Trading with Amazon Echo
Code Snippet which is part of the Alexa implementation to execute trading with Amazon's virutal assistant and using the lemon.markets API. 

## Instructions for Use
This script can be used as a starting point to implement your own trading service with lemon.markets for your virtual assistant from Amazon.
As you can already see, it only contains the Python code that you can use for the Alexa Developer Console.
The Alexa Developer Console is the environment which allows you to add new skills(including intents + sets) for the Alexa home service. 

I'd recommend you to check out the video tutorial "Zero to Hero" from Amazon to understand the use of the Alexa Developer Console.
